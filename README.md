# N-Balls-Visualization

This package will help you to visualize high dimensional balls generated by the method proposed [here](https://github.com/gnodisnait/nball4tree). The method precisely impose tree-structured category information onto word-embeddings, resulting in ball embeddings in higher dimensional spaces (N-balls for short).
