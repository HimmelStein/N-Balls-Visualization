# N-Balls-Visualization

This package will help you to visualize high dimensional balls generated by the method proposed [here](https://github.com/gnodisnait/nball4tree). The method precisely imposes tree-structured category information onto word-embeddings, resulting in ball embeddings in higher dimensional spaces (N-balls for short). In addition to visualizing, the package can also be used to generate balls for a set of input words.

## Getting Started
The package can be used in two ways. The first one by running the [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/ghanem-mhd/N-Balls-Visualization/tree/master/jupyter_notebooks). The second one is just through command line by running the desired function. 

We recommend to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) as it contains all the required dependencies to run this package. Otherwise if you prefer to do it the hard way, feel free to install all the requirements for this package.

In case you want to use jupyter notebooks, please make sure you have the latest version of [Ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets) package. 

In case you want to use the package to generate balls regardless of using jupyter notebooks or command line, make sure you already downloaded Wordnet resource by running the following:
```
implort nltk
nltk.donwload()
```
